- ❌ Don't use archive as primary data source
- ❌ Don't commit changes to archived files
- ❌ Don't ignore archive directory

## 📋 Migration Path

For team members transitioning to clean workspace:

1. **Understand Current State**
   ```bash
   cat ROADMAP_STATUS.md          # Current roadmap
   cat GITHUB_PROJECT_SETUP.md    # GitHub project
   ```

2. **Find Historical Context**
   ```bash
   cat .archive/old-docs/ANALYSIS_REPORT.md          # Historical analysis
   cat .archive/old-docs/ISSUES_AND_FIXES.md         # Old issues (now in GitHub)
   ```

3. **Access Test Reports**
   ```bash
   ls .archive/reports/test-results/
   ls .archive/reports/playwright-report/
   ```

4. **Get Latest Status**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -20              # Recent commits
   gh issue list --repo adhit-r/niyama-policy-as-code  # Current issues
   ```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Future Archive Maintenance
- [ ] Quarterly archive review (move old branches, snapshots)
- [ ] Maintain VERSION_HISTORY for major releases
- [ ] Document archive restoration procedures if needed
- [ ] Archive annual snapshots for compliance
