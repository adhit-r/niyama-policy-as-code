# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements to transform Niyama from a development prototype into a production-ready Policy as Code platform suitable for real company pilot phases. Based on workspace analysis, the focus is on implementing enterprise-grade features with real data integration, establishing a clear product roadmap, and organizing the workspace for scalable development.

**Current State Analysis:**
- Existing multi-agent architecture with Go backend and React frontend
- Mock data services that need real database integration
- Basic authentication without enterprise SSO
- Limited compliance framework data
- Development-focused workspace structure
- Missing production deployment automation

**Target State:**
- Enterprise-ready platform for 50-500 employee companies
- Real data integration with PostgreSQL and Redis
- Comprehensive compliance framework support
- Production-grade security and monitoring
- Clear 18-month product roadmap
- Organized workspace for team collaboration

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enterprise Pilot Readiness

**User Story:** As a DevSecOps engineer at a mid-size company, I want to deploy Niyama in a pilot environment to manage real security policies across our Kubernetes infrastructure, so that I can evaluate its effectiveness for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a company deploys Niyama THEN the system SHALL support multi-tenant architecture with organization isolation
2. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL integrate with enterprise SSO providers (SAML, OIDC)
3. WHEN policies are created THEN the system SHALL enforce RBAC with granular permissions (owner, admin, editor, viewer)
4. WHEN policies are deployed THEN the system SHALL integrate with real Kubernetes clusters via Gatekeeper
5. WHEN violations occur THEN the system SHALL send real-time alerts via Slack, email, and webhooks
6. WHEN compliance reports are needed THEN the system SHALL generate audit-ready reports for SOC2, HIPAA, and GDPR

### Requirement 2: Real Data Integration

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want Niyama to work with our actual infrastructure and compliance data instead of mock responses, so that we can make informed decisions based on real metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to a production PostgreSQL database with proper schema migrations
2. WHEN policies are evaluated THEN the system SHALL use real OPA engine integration with actual policy bundles
3. WHEN metrics are displayed THEN the system SHALL collect real performance data from Prometheus/Grafana
4. WHEN AI features are used THEN the system SHALL integrate with Google Gemini API for actual policy generation
5. WHEN compliance mapping occurs THEN the system SHALL use real compliance framework data from authoritative sources
6. WHEN users access the system THEN authentication SHALL use real JWT tokens with proper session management

### Requirement 3: Product Roadmap and Future Features

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want a clear roadmap for Niyama's evolution from pilot to enterprise platform, so that we can plan development resources and customer expectations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning development THEN the system SHALL have a documented 18-month roadmap with quarterly milestones
2. WHEN evaluating features THEN each roadmap item SHALL include business value, technical complexity, and resource requirements
3. WHEN prioritizing work THEN the roadmap SHALL distinguish between pilot features, enterprise features, and advanced capabilities
4. WHEN considering integrations THEN the roadmap SHALL include cloud provider integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP)
5. WHEN planning AI features THEN the roadmap SHALL include advanced policy optimization and predictive analytics
6. WHEN considering scale THEN the roadmap SHALL include multi-region deployment and global compliance support

### Requirement 4: Workspace Organization and Development Efficiency

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want a well-organized workspace with clear development workflows, so that we can efficiently collaborate and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers work on the project THEN the workspace SHALL have clear separation between backend, frontend, infrastructure, and documentation
2. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL enforce quality gates with automated testing, linting, and security scanning
3. WHEN features are developed THEN the workspace SHALL support feature-branch workflows with proper CI/CD integration
4. WHEN documentation is needed THEN the workspace SHALL maintain up-to-date API documentation, deployment guides, and architecture decisions
5. WHEN environments are managed THEN the workspace SHALL support local development, staging, and production configurations
6. WHEN monitoring is required THEN the workspace SHALL include observability tools for performance, security, and business metrics

### Requirement 5: Data Migration and Seeding

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate from mock data to real production data structures, so that the system can handle actual enterprise workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is initialized THEN it SHALL include real compliance framework data (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR controls)
2. WHEN templates are loaded THEN the system SHALL include production-ready policy templates for common use cases
3. WHEN users are onboarded THEN the system SHALL support bulk user import from existing identity systems
4. WHEN policies are migrated THEN the system SHALL provide tools to import existing OPA policies and Gatekeeper constraints
5. WHEN organizations are set up THEN the system SHALL support configuration templates for different company sizes and industries

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want Niyama to handle enterprise-scale workloads with thousands of policies and millions of evaluations, so that it can support large organizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN policies are evaluated THEN the system SHALL handle 10,000+ policy evaluations per second
2. WHEN the database grows THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling with read replicas
3. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL auto-scale API services based on load
4. WHEN caching is needed THEN the system SHALL implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide detailed metrics on response times, throughput, and resource usage

### Requirement 7: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want Niyama itself to meet enterprise security standards, so that we can confidently deploy it in our production environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is transmitted THEN all communications SHALL use TLS 1.3 encryption
2. WHEN data is stored THEN sensitive information SHALL be encrypted at rest using AES-256
3. WHEN vulnerabilities are discovered THEN the system SHALL have automated security scanning in CI/CD
4. WHEN access is granted THEN the system SHALL log all user actions for audit purposes
5. WHEN secrets are managed THEN the system SHALL integrate with enterprise secret management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
6. WHEN compliance is audited THEN the system SHALL maintain SOC2 Type II compliance for the platform itself

### Requirement 8: Product Roadmap and Strategic Planning

**User Story:** As a product stakeholder, I want a comprehensive 18-month roadmap with clear milestones and feature prioritization, so that we can plan resources and set customer expectations for the platform evolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning development cycles THEN the roadmap SHALL define quarterly milestones with specific deliverables
2. WHEN evaluating features THEN each roadmap item SHALL include business value score, technical complexity, and resource requirements
3. WHEN prioritizing work THEN the roadmap SHALL categorize features as pilot-ready, enterprise-ready, or advanced capabilities
4. WHEN considering market positioning THEN the roadmap SHALL include competitive analysis and differentiation strategies
